Element token is intended to be created only by the tokenizer
The tokenizer is used to read in the full chemical name, that's it. It is not used at all when reading the element data.
DO NOT use it for reading in the element data. The element data is stored as element objects.
I changed the code back to use Element to store data, not element token.

TL;DR (But please do read it): Element token is only used when reading in data from the tokenizer.
Class Element is used to store information about each element.
